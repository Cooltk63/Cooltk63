**Subject:** Update on Project Task Completion and Delay

**Dear [Manager's Name],**

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to update you on the current status of our project tasks and to inform you of the reasons for the delay in our project timeline.

As of today, we have completed 2 tasks, while the rest are still in progress. Unfortunately, we have encountered several challenges that have impacted our ability to meet the original project timeline. The key issues are as follows:

1. **Node.js Package Download Issues:** Every system in our setup experienced issues with downloading necessary Node.js packages. This problem has caused significant delays as it affected all team members.

2. **Maven Dependency Download Issues:** We faced problems with downloading Maven dependencies due to proxy server issues. Resolving these configuration problems took 2-3 days on each team memberâ€™s system, further delaying our progress.

3. **Team Member Availability:** Some of our team members have been on leave, which has impacted our overall productivity and contributed to the delays.

4. **Incomplete Project Base Setup:** The project base setup is still not 100% completed. This has had a cascading effect on our ability to progress with other tasks that depend on the base setup being finalized.

I understand the importance of adhering to our project timeline and apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. We are working diligently to resolve these issues and expedite the remaining tasks. I will provide regular updates on our progress and any further challenges we may encounter.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

**Best regards,**
